If your class provides more functionality rather than just
 running as Thread, you should implement Runnable interface to provide a way to run it as Thread.
 If your class only goal is to run as Thread, you can extend Thread class.

Implementing Runnable is preferred because java supports implementing multiple interfaces.
If you extend Thread class, you canâ€™t extend any other classes.
